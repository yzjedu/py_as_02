# Programming Assignment 2

## Problem

Write a program that asks the user to enter the month (represented as a number in the range 1 through 12) and the year. The program should then display the number of days in that month. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:

- Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and only if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.
- If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.

Example: if the user enters 2 for the month and 2008 for the year, the program should say that month has 29 days.

## Instructions

1. Create a new Python file and place intro comments using the template below.
2. Use comments to write the algorithm your program will follow.
3. Draw a flowchart and label the possible control paths. You may draw it using pen and paper and then submit a picture.
4. Write the Python code corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
5. Test your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
